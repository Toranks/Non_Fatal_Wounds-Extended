Non-Fatal Wound System
======================

This is an add-on campaign for the game [Wesnoth](https://www.wesnoth.org/).

In-game description (for the add-ons server)
--------------------------------------------

When a unit reaches 0 hp, instead of dying, it’s merely removed for the current scenario.  And when scenario ends the “wounded” units go back into the “recall” pool for next mission!

This will affect campaign balance, but makes the RNG much less punishing of mistakes, while still being not too lenient (losing a unit still stings because you lose the opportunity to level them up).

EARLY EXPERIMENTAL VERSION - created for discussion, but only briefly tested. This was inspired by Armagedonus's suggestion in [a thread discussing save-scumming](https://r.wesnoth.org/p641153).
