# In SotA, Shynal's death causes her to be raised as a walking corpse, so this specific death needs to be avoided without triggering the campaign's name=die event.
# She starts as a level 0, so it's likely that a player using this mod will put her in danger to try and level up.

# The mechanism to do this is to use kill=yes in the [store_unit] tag. That could be generalised, but let's have some campaign-specific dialogue instead.
