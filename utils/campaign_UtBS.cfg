#textdomain wesnoth-Non_Fatal_Wounds

# UtBS S02's events clear the dehydration status in a victory event. One option would be to copy
# that code here, and hope that it doesn't change; another option is to spawn the clones of the
# wounded units before the victory event fires.
#
# As this is a single-player campaign, the local_victory event is guaranteed to fire, and it's
# unit-tested to fire before victory (in data/test/scenarios/events-test_victory.cfg).
